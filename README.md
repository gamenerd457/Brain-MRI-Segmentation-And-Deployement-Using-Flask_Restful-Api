# Brain-MRI-Segmentation-And-Deployement-Using-Flask_Restful-Api
In this project I have trained a UNet model to predict masks for brain image segmentation and the model has been deployed using flask_restful api,so that we can get the output by sending a POST request

## Dataset:-
https://www.kaggle.com/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation
This dataset contains brain MR images together with manual FLAIR abnormality segmentation masks.
The images were obtained from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA).
They correspond to 110 patients included in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) lower-grade glioma collection with at least fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence and genomic cluster data available.
