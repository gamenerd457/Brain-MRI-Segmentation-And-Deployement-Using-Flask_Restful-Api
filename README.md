# Brain-MRI-Segmentation-And-Deployment-Using-Flask_Restful-Api
In this project I have trained a UNet model to predict masks for brain image segmentation and the model has been deployed using flask_restful api,so that we can get the output by sending a POST request

## Dataset:-
https://www.kaggle.com/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation <br />
This dataset contains brain MR images together with manual FLAIR abnormality segmentation masks. <br />
The images were obtained from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). <br />
They correspond to 110 patients included in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) lower-grade glioma collection with at least fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence and genomic cluster data available. <br />

### Results:-
